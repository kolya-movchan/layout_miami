# Miami landing page

This work is considered to be my first landing project and there are a few main tools used I would like to highlight:
  - BEM (the structure of the HTML page was done in accordance with BEM technologies to structure the code and enable its refactoring);

  - SAAS (the CSS code was compilled from the developed SAAS code with its variables, mixin and loops);

  - Display Grid (in a combination with BEM modifiers and SAAS loops this mix allowed us to easily locate the items throughout the whole page by changing the modifiers in the HTML);

  - Position Fixed (was used to locate wisely the navigation menu page);

  - JS (a piece of the Javascript code was used to disable scrolling on the "Menu" page and enable it for the rest of the webpages; to prevent the default behavior of the "submit" button reloading the page);

  - Anchors (implemented to easily navigate from the menu to the corresponding page on the main webpage);

  - Telephone Link (created to enable the calling option on the website);

  - Form (is a way for the client to fill in his name, email and the message to pass this data to the server);

  - Transition (this tool was choosed to make a smooth appearing/disappearing of the page, phone number, photos, links and the buttons).
